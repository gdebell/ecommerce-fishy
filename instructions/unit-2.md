# Unit 2 Team Project: eCommerce Site


### Getting Started

You will be working with a pair to go from the front-end eCommerce site to a more fully functional application. The site will include the following:

* A front and back-end, including a SQL Database
* Payment Processing through Stripe
* User Authentication
* Admin views and special privileges


### Acceptance Criteria

You will be deciding the stories, data model, and overall process with your pair. However, the end goal must include the following:

* Working and correctly implemented routes
* An integrated, styled error page
* A database that keeps track of necessarily persistent data
* The ability for users to login and see their unique prior purchases on a new "Orders" page
* The ability for an admin to log in to the site to view all purchases and to add,
  edit, or remove new products from the site
* The ability for a user to request a new password be sent to their email if they
  have forgotten it


##### After being assigned pairs, do the following:

1. Have one member of your team create a new Project on Tracker.
  * Click the settings button (it looks like a little gear) and go to the Members tab.
  * Add the other member of your team to the project.
1. Have one member of your team create a new repository on Github for your project.
  * Add the other member of your team to the repository.
  * As a team, discuss your workflow. Will you require PRs? Different branches?
1. As a team, choose which prior eCommerce front-end you'd like to build out. If you don't want to use either/don't have a completed version, talk to your instructors.
1. As a team, begin to plan out how you'd like to get all the above features done. Begin to make stories, ERDs, and whatever else you might need to be fully prepared.
  * It is likely that you may not know exactly what needs to be done for topics we have yet to cover. Do your best to put together stories based on the intended feature; not the implementation.
1. Split up the work by assigning individual people to tasks; but, work together to get everything done!


Your instructors will share more on the schedule and any deadlines. Have fun!
